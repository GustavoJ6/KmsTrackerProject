# KmsTrackerProject
 KmsTracker - My second project

Since my father gave me and my brother a car we always had the problem of being far with the kms each one spent, and how much gas should each one fill the
car with.

For that reason I spent some time learning how to use my Java Knowledge, at the time, and learning how to program an application for android.
This project had a really positive impact on me as it was the first time I developed a whole app on my own, the first time I used a GUI and the first
time I worked with OOP. Adding to that it was also the first time I actually used my development skills to build something for me and that actually 
impacts my day to day life.

APP SHORT DESCRIPTION:

This application has the main goal of keeping in track the KMS that each user has.
It has several functionalities, such as: "Note a Ride", where the user inserts the total KMs the car is displaying and the app automatically
uses that information to recalculate the KMs of the user that made the input; "Add Kms", where the user inputs how many litters of gas he added to 
the car and his total is incremented accordingly; "Check Info", where the user can see the KMs all the users have and also all the rides that were noted
previously; and the last "Calculator" where the user can manually input the price of the gas, the litters, the kms and the money, and do all the 
calculations he needs.

I consider this project as finished, and although its utility, with a deeper knowledge of OOP and CSS it could be a much better and eye-pleasing application (maybe something for the future...).
